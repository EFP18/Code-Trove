### Description

Code Trove is a website that targets an audience of coders of all levels. It provides them with a platform where they can open an account and save important code snippets, boilerplate code, and more, in their profile, as well as share their snippets with other coders.

### Installation

In order for a user to run our project locally, they need to have VS Code installed. Once they open the project on VS Code, they need to install all the necessary dependencies by typing `npm i`. Then, the user needs to type `npm start`, which will activate their localhost, at which point the website can be accessed online by typing http://localhost:3001/ in the URL field.

The project is deployed using `Heroku`, so anybody can access the website through the link mentioned above.

### Technologies Used

- `Node.js` and `Express.js` - Create RESTful API.
- `Handlebars.js` as template engine.
- MySQL and Sequelize ORM.
- This project follows an MVC paradigm.
- Environment variables to protect API keys and sensitive information.
- `Highlight.js` and `getform.io`.

### Usage
